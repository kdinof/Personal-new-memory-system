# Guided Conversation Flow

Step-by-step guide for the interactive retro mode.

## Before Starting

Read `memory/current-focus.md` to get the user's current primary goal. You'll need it for Section 2.

## Section 1: ⚡ One Win

Ask:
> "What's one win from today? It can be small — a good conversation, something you finished, a moment you're proud of."

- If user gives multiple wins, pick the strongest one for this section. Mention others in Brain Dump.
- If user says "nothing" or "bad day", gently probe: "Nothing at all? Even a small thing — a good meal, a task checked off?" If still nothing, respect it and write what they give.

## Section 2: 🎯 Did I move toward my main goal?

If `current-focus.md` has a primary goal:
> "Your main focus is **[PRIMARY FOCUS]**. Did you make progress on it today? What specifically?"

If `current-focus.md` is empty or has no clear goal:
> "What's the main thing you're working toward right now? Did you make progress on it today?"

- Accept honest "no" without judgment.
- If no progress, ask: "What got in the way?" — put the answer in Brain Dump, not here.
- Keep this section factual: what was done or not done.

## Section 3: 🧠 Brain Dump

Ask:
> "Anything else on your mind? Worries, ideas, unfinished things, plans for tomorrow — dump it all here."

- Encourage stream-of-consciousness.
- Don't organize too aggressively — keep the user's voice and structure.
- If user is brief, that's fine. Don't push for more.

## After All Sections

Show the complete retro in the file template format. Ask:
> "Save this?"

If yes, write the file. If user wants changes, edit and ask again.
